* Cost reduction
** confluent cost
** MSK const
** TiCDC cost
* What TiCDC can do
** Add glue schema registry support in the TiCDC (other schema registry)
*** Block: How to support MSK's endpoint
** Add replication to oracle directly. (Redshift/Postgres/Big Query as well)
   If we are able to support oracle replication, it will open a door to other database as well.
** Add other stream like kinese/pubsub/pulsar/flink
** Add replication to go-plugin(grpc)
   If we are able to add go-plugin as the downsteam, it will open one door to trigger(after change)
** Add branch of insert/update/delete and specified columns
